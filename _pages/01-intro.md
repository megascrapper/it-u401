## Background
Android vs iOS, they're one of the biggest battles in the 21st century. You may notice this daily by people arguing which phone is the best. I have wondered however, does this split the same across different genders? Does one gender prefer one phone more than another? I predicted that if you are female, then you are more likely to own an iPhone. I also wondered whether the type of phone used is related to the tech savviness of the owner. 

I’m interested in the topic because from my observation, I noticed that female tend to use iOS devices than male, who I observed tend to use Android more. I am also interested whether this also has anything to do with the tech savviness of the user, and whether men are better at technology than women.
