Using the techniques described in the [previous page](/mobile-phones-and-gender/intro/), Here is the data that is collected. Specifically, this page discusses the primary data collected.

The survey is conducted from 30th of April to May 11th 2018. There are 35 participants in the survey, 18 of them were male and 16 of them were female.

All participants are between years 10 and 12, which is between the age of 15 to 18.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/year-level.png" alt="A pie chart on year level. Year 10: 32.43%, Year 11: 51.35%, Year 12: 16.22%" %} 

44% of the responses were recorded through Google Forms, while the rest were done on paper.

All of the participants have a mobile phone, and overall about 2/3 of them use iOS.

However, when gender is taken into consideration, it becomes clear that women tend to own an iPhone more than men. While male participants are still mostly dominated by iOS users, it is lower than the overall percentage with 61% of participants using iPhones. On the other hand, 75% of female participants use iPhones while only 25% of females use Android phones.

From the figures above, it shows that within Wellington Secondary College, females are more likely to use an iPhone than male. 

### Why people chose different phones?
To find out why does female more likely to use iOS devices, I asked the participants why they chose the particular platform. Here are the some of the results:

|Why people choose iOS|Why people choose Android|
|---------------------|-------------------------|
|"I like the simplicity and speed of iOS, also all of my family are iPhone users"|"More customisation options"|
|"It was a hand me down."|"because i am used to it and android is easier to use"|
|"Because it's the only phone I have"|"I had no choice but to change to android because I needed a new phone and my dad's phone was an android; he was willing to give it to me. "|
|"better quality"|"Because I have a Samsung"|
|"on an iPhone therefore automatically iOS"|"clean and customisable"|

<!-- The video below shows why people chose one smartphone platform over another.  -->
<!-- TODO: video -->

From the table <!-- and video --> above, we can see that some participants use a particular phone not out of choice, but because either it's a hand-me down, because their family are in one ecosystem, or simply because that's what the phone came with. Out of those who prefer one platform over another, they cited speed, simplicity, customisation and familiarity. 

From the survey data, there doesn't seem any differences in reasons across genders. 

## Primary data conlcusion
From the primary data above, it is clear that females are more likely to use iPhones while males prefer Android devices.
