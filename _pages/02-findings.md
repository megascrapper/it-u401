## Primary data
There are 35 participants to the survey, all of which are fro years 10 to 12. 18 of them were male and 16 of them were female.

All of the participants have a mobile phone, and overall about 2/3 of them use iOS. 

However, when gender is taken into consideration, it becomes clear that women tends to own an iPhone more than men. 

## Secondary data
The primary data has many limitations and issues, namely the limited sample size and coverage. Therefore to test whether the hypothesis is proven a secondary data is needed. All of the data came from either the US or UK and made between 2013 and 2017. I collected 8 different sources of secondary data from the internet about mobile phone demographics, ranging from premade charts to news articles. Out of the 8 sources, 7 of them stated that iPhones are used more by men and women. 

Examples of secondary data saying that iPhones are used more by men:
A news report by eMarketer in 2013 reported that male and younger users favour Android over iOS.
Both Forbes and Cnet had an article showing a research about phone brand preference. The result shows that more women prefer Apple than men.
A statistic by Statista shows that more women use an iOS device while men uses Android more, both in their 2014 and 2015 statistic. 
Verto Analytics also reported that the install base of iPhones are larger among female users.
GlobalWebIndex stated that around 18% of women and 17% of men used Appleâ€™s system (ie. more iPhone users by women).

However, there are also sources that reports that more of iPhone users were male:
A research by Fluent in 2016 shows that men are slightly more likely to be iOS users than women.

As more secondary sources stating that women are more likely to use an iPhone, it shows that my primary data matches with those from secondary sources.
