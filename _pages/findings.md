Using the techniques described in the [previous page](/mobile-phones-and-gender/intro/), Here is the data that is collected. 
## Primary data
The survey is conducted from 30th of April to May 11th 2018. There are 35 participants in the survey, 18 of them were male and 16 of them were female.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/gender.png" alt="A pie chart on gender. Male: 52.94%, Female: 47.06%" %} 

All participants are between years 10 and 12, which is between the age of 15 to 18.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/year-level.png" alt="A pie chart on year level. Year 10: 32.43%, Year 11: 51.35%, Year 12: 16.22%" %} 

44% of the responses were recorded through Google Forms, while the rest were done on paper.

All of the participants have a mobile phone, and overall about 2/3 of them use iOS.

However, when gender is taken into consideration, it becomes clear that women tend to own an iPhone more than men. While male participants are still mostly dominated by iOS users, it is lower than the overall percentage with 61% of participants using iPhones. On the other hand, 75% of female participants use iPhones while only 25% of females use Android phones.

From the figures above, it shows that within Wellington Secondary College, females are more likely to use an iPhone than male. 

### Why people chose different phones?
To find out why does female more likely to use iOS devices, I asked the participants why they chose the particular platform. Here are the some of the results:

|Why people choose iOS|Why people choose Android|
|---------------------|-------------------------|
|"I like the simplicity and speed of iOS, also all of my family are iPhone users"|"More customisation options"|
|"It was a hand me down."|"because i am used to it and android is easier to use"|
|"Because it's the only phone I have"|"I had no choice but to change to android because I needed a new phone and my dad's phone was an android; he was willing to give it to me. "|
|"better quality"|"Because I have a Samsung"|
|"on an iPhone therefore automatically iOS"|"clean and customisable"|

<!-- The video below shows why people chose one smartphone platform over another.  -->
<!-- TODO: video -->

From the table <!-- and video --> above, we can see that some participants use a particular phone not out of choice, but because either it's a hand-me down, because their family are in one ecosystem, or simply because that's what the phone came with. Out of those who prefer one platform over another, they cited speed, simplicity, customisation and familiarity. 

From the survey data, there doesn't seem any differences in reasons across genders. 

## Secondary data
The primary data has many limitations and issues, namely the limited sample size and coverage. Therefore to test whether the hypothesis is proven a secondary data is needed. All of the data came from either the US or the UK and made between 2013 and 2017. I collected 8 different sources of secondary data from the internet about mobile phone demographics, ranging from premade charts to news articles. Out of the 8 sources, 7 of them stated that iPhones are used more by men and women. 

Examples of secondary data saying that iPhones are used more by men:
* [A news report](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/US-Smartphone-OS-Race-Still-Close-Men-Younger-Users-Favor-Android/1009961) by eMarketer in 2013 reported that male and younger users favour Android over iOS, with 26% of women using iPhones, compared to 24% for men. The news article used a survey from the Pew Internet & American Life Project.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/emarketer.png" alt="A bar graph showing mobile phone share by gender, titled 'Smartphone market share in the US, 2013'. On the iOS side (left), male (blue) is 24% while female (pink) is 26%. On the Android side, male is 31% and females are 26%." caption="Source: [eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/US-Smartphone-OS-Race-Still-Close-Men-Younger-Users-Favor-Android/1009961)" %} 

* [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2014/04/10/what-kind-of-person-prefers-an-iphone/#32f0b97bd1b0) ran an article where the author analysed a dataset from CivicScience. He noted that people who preferred Android were 56% male and 44% female, which indicates a strong factor in gender. The author also noted that people who used Android devices are "more hard-core techies" and are "more comfortable with the more open but less polished Android user experience". This matches one of the stated reasons of why people chose Android, which is customisability.

* [Verto Analytics](https://www.vertoanalytics.com/apple-iphone-ownership-driven-female-high-income-users/) also reported that the install base of iPhones is larger among female users. It also stated that women chose iPhones because of its design and user experience. Meanwhile, men valued more variety and functions that Android offers.

On the iOS side (LHS), males are 34% and females are 41%, while On Android side (centre), males are 60% and females are 40%. The 'other' side (RHS) has 3% for male and female." caption="Source: [Verto Analytics](https://www.vertoanalytics.com/apple-iphone-ownership-driven-female-high-income-users/)" %} 

Other news sources that reported higher iPhone usage among female are...
* [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/iphone/11335574/Women-more-likely-to-own-an-iPhone-than-men.html) (which uses data from  GlobalWebIndex),
* [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/women-prefer-apple-gentlemen-prefer-samsung), which cited a research sponsored by KS Mobile,
* and statistics website Statista, which collects data from the UK across different years.

While there are multiple sources that reported higher iPhone usage among females, this is not the case with all sources. This is shown in a market research by Fluent in 2016, which shows that 26% of female respondents are an iOS user, slightly less 28.3% of males that uses iOS.

On the right hand side, the share of 'other' is shown. The male bar shows 1.1% while the female graph shows 0.7%." caption="Source: [Fluent](http://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fluent2_DevicesandDemographics_2016.pdf)" %} 
Despite that, I am fairly confident that the statistic above is an outlier and secondary sources matches the primary data that I collected.
