From the [findings page](/mobile-phones-and-gender/findings/), it is clear that both the primary data and the secondary data shows that there is a clear difference in mobile phone usage share across males and females. Both the primary data and secondary data demonstrates that females are more likely to use an iPhone than males. Therefore, my hypothesis that females are more likely to use iPhones has been proven to be true.
