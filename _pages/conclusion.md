From the [findings page](https://megascrapper.github.io/mobile-phones-and-gender/findings/), it is clear that both the primary data and the secondary data shows that there is a clear difference in mobile phone usage share across males and females. Both the primary data and secondary data demonstrates that females are more likely to use an iPhone than males. Therefore, my hypothesis that females are more likely to use iPhones has been proven to be true. However, there is no solid proof that there is a difference in reasons why people chose a phone between males and females.

While I concluded that there is a difference in mobile phone usage share across genders, there are many variables and limitations associated with this research. If I have been given more time and have better secondary datasets, the results might have been different. 

## What next?
If you managed to get this far, congratulations!
