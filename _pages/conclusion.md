In order to support my conclusion, I used data that is authoritative, relevant and timely. Here is an explanation to the points above:
* **Authoritative data** is data that has been sourced from an authentic and trustworthy sources, to ensure that the information generated ius not false of misleading.
* A **relevant data** is data that is related to the research topic. FOr example, since I am investigating about phone market share, I wouldn't use a data about the number of dogs, since they have nothing to do to my research topic.
* A **Timely data** is data that is relevant to the time span that is being studied. For my case, I aim to source data from a maximum age of 5 years old, since the mobile phone world is changing rapidly.

The primary data ticks all of the points above, as I am the one who collected the data and it is conducted only a few months prior to making this site.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/phone-os-gender.png" alt="A pie chart on survey mobile phone OS by gender. On the male pie chart, iOS (blue) is 61.11% while Android (green) is 38.89%. On the female chart, iOS is 75% and Android is 25%." caption="Data source: primary data from survey" %}

All of the secondary data used either came from websites such as [Statista](https://www.statista.com/), Market research organisations such as [Verto](https://www.vertoanalytics.com/), or news sites. I consider secondary sources from Statista,Verto or [Pew Research](http://www.pew.org/) to be highly authoritative as they collected the data by themselves, and the quality of the data is likely to be accurate.

Here is a chart from one of the statistics organisation.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/statista-2017.png" alt="A bar graph showing mobile phone share by gender, titled 'Smartphone market share in the UK, 2017'. On the male side (LHS), iOS are 34%, Android are 54% and others are 3%, while on female side (RHS), iOS are 41%, Android are 46% and others are 3%." caption="Data source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/732632/share-of-cell-phone-brands-owned-in-the-uk-by-gender/)" %}

Here is an example of a chart from a news site, which sourced their data from [Pew Research](http://www.pew.org/), a major research organisation.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/emarketer.png" alt="A bar graph showing mobile phone share by gender, titled 'Smartphone market share in the US, 2013'. On the ale side (left), iOS (blue) is 24% while Android (green) is 31%. On the female side, iOS is 26% and Android is 26%." caption="Data source: [eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/US-Smartphone-OS-Race-Still-Close-Men-Younger-Users-Favor-Android/1009961)" %}

From the charts above, as well as  almost all of the other sources that is found in the [findings page](https://megascrapper.github.io/mobile-phones-and-gender/findings/), it is clear that both the primary data and the secondary data shows that there is a clear difference in mobile phone usage share across males and females.

In conclusion, my hypothesis that females are more likely to use iPhones has been proven to be true.

## Limitations
While I concluded that there is a difference in mobile phone usage share across genders, there are many variables and limitations associated with this research. If I have been given more time and have better secondary datasets, the results might have been different.

## What next?
If you managed to get this far, congratulations!
